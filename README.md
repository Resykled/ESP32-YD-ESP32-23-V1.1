**YD-ESP32-23-V1.1 – KiCad Footprint, Symbol & 3D Model**

This repository provides a complete KiCad component set for the YD-ESP32-23-V1.1 module.
Included are:

Schematic symbol,
PCB footprint,
3D model (STEP) for realistic board preview.

**Features:**

Pinout matched to the official YD-ESP32-23-V1.1 module

Footprint dimensions verified against mechanical drawings

3D model aligned and centered for KiCad’s default orientation

Clean library structure (/symbol, /footprint, /3dmodel)

**Usage:**

Clone or download the repository.

Add the symbol/footprint libraries to your KiCad project via
Preferences → Manage Symbol Libraries and Manage Footprint Libraries.

Add the STEP file to your 3D model path if needed.

Place the symbol, link it to the footprint, and you’re set.

**Notes:**

Double-check paste-mask and courtyard if you run unusual manufacturing rules.
If you find misalignment or pin naming inconsistencies, open an issue.
